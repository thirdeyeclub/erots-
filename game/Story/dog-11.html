                        The heat of the sun and the heat of your body energizes the hair on your body. Somewhere, some where. The varemnt runs just out of grasp, darting into rat holes and beath bush limbs. You easily smash thought. The tempo of your four legs matches the tempo of blood coursing through your naked body. You have come to an injunction, and lost sight of your prey. Which way did that varment go? The sent on the wind says east towards the master's fields, the sweat on the leaves and broken branches lead deeper into the forest.
