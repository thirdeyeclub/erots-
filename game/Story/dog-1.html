                  You have reached one of the highest points in the karmadic cycle you are the happiest creature alive. your master is benevolent. he feeds you every day, at the same time. He loves you as much as you would like to think your own mother would have but you have never met her. Roaming down the woodscapes, seeing far, hearing the steps of the small creatures. the rise in fall again, you chase the wind and every bird. the human's steel pipe sings. He owns all you know, but its all you will ever need. out in the road one day you catch the sent of tear bear, you began to rip after it the underbrush keeps you back. And then it comes your master calls you back to providence.
