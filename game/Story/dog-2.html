                        The midnight sun approaches. God and the devil are battling in the sky above you. Every color imaginable lights up the sky. Overlayed are the stars. Shinging down on a single dog, you. Moving east. In search of something. You smell something you never have before. A burning smell. That of stone melting and screams coming from the direction of the nearby village. A single rabbit stand opposite you across a dirt road. You both stare at each other. Nor friend nor foe will know with what to lengths ill go in order to flush out these devils. A loud explosion rocks the earth around you. The rabbit turns tail towards the village, towards the smoke. It would be certain death, you think.
