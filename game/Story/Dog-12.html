                        Trotting over to your old master. You have known him all your life, he often remarks that you are his best friend. but you know that is a lie. He spends all his time with that wicked sound box. Staring into it form after the chorse are done to until he becomes undone. Often asleep and dreaming. You curl up next to him. The only warmth he has felt in some time during this cold october. He tells you to come inside, then takes his usual spot on the big blue sofa. He asks you to stay as he dozes off.  But you are free when the master sleeps.
